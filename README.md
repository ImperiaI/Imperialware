# Imperialware
Mod Manager and Cheating Tool for Star Wars - Empire at War and its extension Forces of Corruption.

Dear fellow Modders and @all Users! 

I'm so pleased to present you a new gear I wrote for Star Wars - EAW and FOC. 
It's Name is Imperialware and it's a Cheating Tool, Modmanager, Unit Creator and Universal Launcher. 


Download to built the .exe file (v0.1):

-/ How to use: I prepared over 2 Hours of presentation video material in 5 tutorials for you:

It is a multifunction tool, a Mod Manager that is built to launch any mod for EAW and FOC. 
It's the first application to support mod mods, in order to allow little changes to mods, 
without breaking their usual functionality. 

The probably most interesting feature for you guys is the CHEATING tab, which allows the User to simply spawn any unit 
of the chosen mod, modifying them and creating new units without the prerequisite of knowing anything about xml.


-/ Historical Information: 
I just needed a UI that enables me to use my Lua scripts for cheat spawning units, and I thought it would be cool 
to have a better universal launcher, as most Launchers are pretty poor in terms of design. 

By the time I added more and more functions, and finally it turned into a Modmanager project of bigger size. 
I also kept promising a Cheating tool to the users in our Stargate forums for some years now, and promises must be kept, right? 

Thus, I learned C# programming, wrote these 17.600 lines of (compressed) code, designed a iOS style User interface 
and tinkered around to get this C# - Lua - Xml hybrid running. 


In the development I focused especially on matters of UI Design and costumizability. The user can change UI color and 
the background image of the Launch tab.

The main reason for writing this application was because I am going to use it for Launching the Andromeda mod I am going 
to start in the future. Beside of that, as I needed to have a look at C# anyway in order to be able to use Visual Studio, 
I thought it will be a good practice for me to keep the learned stuff in my head.

However, Imperialware is an open source project so anyone is allowed to include Imperialware to the download of his Mod and to modify or further distribute it at will. 
In this case I'd be thankful to see myself credited in your documentation but this is not required.



- Tested and verified to work on Windows 7, 8.1 and Windows 10 
Also, I'm appreciating any feedback. 

To update to a new version just put the downloads of new Imperialware versions 
together with their Imperialware_Installation.zip into the same directory and start the .exe, 
it will automatically update then.

As Imperialware is not done yet, there is a list of major features I still intend to add: 

- Launch support for Steam (nr.1 priority! Then Imperialware will also be uploaded to Moddb) 
- 2 Last Size Expanders in the "Manage" tab: Hardpoints (for automatic Hardpoint creation) and Particles, 
embedded in a balancing environment. 

- The Unit Creator is currently only working for the creation of Squadrons, Corvettes, Frigates and Capital ships which 
concludes the space part of EAW. However, I am going to extend that to all classes for ground mode and Buildings 
in order to cover all classes, as land classes are not functional yet. 

- In the video the 3 Bubble buttons can be dragged around on the screen, I disabled that feature because it caused crashes. 
As soon I am able to stabilize that issue I'll reactivate this feature. 

- A + Button to create own templates of new Mods and Addons. 
- AI Defibrilator Function: Another dummy that spawns at Galactic layer and allows resurrecting or creating 
any Enemy AI and the ability to program a fleet of enemy ships. 
Then a random amount of Ships of Random Classes will keep attacking you and push you to the very limits of every galactic conflict. 

- (Optional) Planet Creator/Editor; Yes, it will auto generate a nice cluster of Planets which are dragg
and drop able to influence their position. You would also influence their appearance, size and whether the ground of them 
is accessible or not. 

- Localization: I will add a translation for the German language, then if any user likes to help me to translate button texts 
I could extend to more languages. 

- Apps Library information support for some more mods. 

You like the concept of Imperialware and would like to help?
 
This is how you could help me through the developing process: 
- Art: You can find photo shop templates for buttons in .\Imperialware\Themes\Default (the Theme with all buttons). 
If you are able to work with 2D applications you could use these files as template to create your own Imperialware themes. 
Then please contact me here in the forums or using my Moddb account: Imperiai (last letter is an i because 
accountname with L was not free) or on youtube, in order to apply your themes. 
If they are nice I will include them to the next release of Imperialware (together with credits in the Info button area) 

- Code: I uploaded the sourcecode to Github, as Imperialware is an open project 
(see license in "settings/Info button") But as I have no experience with Visual Studio's Presentation Forms I made Imperialware 
for the normal Forms, which certainly will be a drawback (also I coded it in my very own style). 
I already apologize now for the mess, Imperialware is my first bigger program so please don't judge too hard.
In future I indeed intend to participate that code upon more classes, please don't judge too hard as this is my first bigger program. 

- Support: Any beta test data or feedback is always welcome to me.
- Translation: Later I will be translating the whole UI, then I would need help to translate the stuff into other languages. 

You like how the program works? Imperialware is nice but Anakin_Sklavenwalker, a friend of mine is going to build a similar 
universal tool. But for his project he aims even higher than me: Rebuilding some areas of the EAW game engine in order to 
integrate a new alo viewer into his Unit creator program. 
It will take a few years until accomplishes that, if you are a Modder you could use Imperialware meanwhile for your daily modding.

As User, you would have Imperialware to do anything against your frustration once one of your very best unique units was killed 
and you want to cheat it back, or also to enables you defeating overpowered AIs. 
Or if you feel the desire to make this one ship build able to your faction you saw battling at enemy side 
(Now achievable within 4 clicks.) 
Finally, I'd like to thank my Imperialware Beta Testers,
